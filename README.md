# sit725 Pracs - Portfolio / Assignment 1

This is my personal portfolio website. It was created through intermittent practicals at Deakin Universit yin SIT725. 

It requires docker to be installed on the environment on which the app runs.

After installing, run the program using: 
  
  > docker run -d - p 5000:8080 jlitsas/portfolio
 
OR if not using docker: 
  
  > npm start

Once running, you can access the server via the following URL:

  > http:localhost:8080

# files
The most important file is 
> server.js

This files holds the configuration for system, and was written in node.js.
